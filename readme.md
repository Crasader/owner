This is a Laravel 5.0 project. Showcasing ajax dependent dropdown functionality, in which subcategories are dynamically populated from the database, based upon the category selected.  This project is largely modeled on Design Code Blade Nepal's youtube video (below) in which they built a similar dependent dropdown in Laravel 4.2.  When I migrated this project to Laravel 5.0 controllers and models were added to shift functions out of the routes.php file.
